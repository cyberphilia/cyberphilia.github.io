    Technical Experience
    --------------------

    My Cool Side Project
    :   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
        list can be used to have named items.

        * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
          indentation levels in the markdown source.
        * Second item.

    Open Source
    :   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
        the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
        implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
        (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
        your idea...

    Programming Languages
    :   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
        to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
        mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
        here is a description list where the first few items have their
        first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
        emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
        version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

    :   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
        perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
        reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
        file).

    :   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
        it.

    :   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

    Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
    ----------------------------------------

    * Human Languages:

         * English (native speaker)
         * ???
         * This is what a nested list looks like.

    * Random tidbit

    * Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
